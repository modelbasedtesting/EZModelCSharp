The Stanford H3 Viewer project was downloaded from Stanford University web site.
The GLUT flavor of the H3 Viewer code, including the GLUT example main program,
was extracted to this project.
What remains in this project is the transformation of the features of the
H3 Viewer to WebGL JavaScript.  WebGL 1 will be an acceptable outcome.
WebGL 2 is desired.
